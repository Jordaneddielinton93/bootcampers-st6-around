<h2>Overview</h1>
<hr/>
<p>
  Over the past six months we have done an amazing job with how much we have learnt. but why stop now .This Repo has all the rule's needed for our next project. 
  I cant wait to hear everyones idea's
</p>

<h2>This Weeks Objectives</h2>

<h3>Asperations</h3>

- Be able to pick a Team Leader
- Set ground rules for everyone
- Pick a project to work on
- Pick a name for the Team 

<h2>Rules - not final</h2>




1. Never push to main yourself, only after a code review and <b>do not fix others code</b> tell them their error with a code review via github & then on slack < "important". Then ask them to fix it (we all make mistake's so do not become protective of your code).

2. ^ People love to help and we are a team so ask for help. 
3. Do not work on a coponent if somone else is working on it to stop merge errors, if you need help ask or pair-codeðŸ˜Š
4. If you stop replying after a week and do not tell anybody, your ticket will be removed and placed on the backlog.
5. if you pick a ticket/component to work on <b>let people know</b> and move it under your name on Jira.
6. Be respectfull , if you have an issue bring it up
7. If their is a bug bring it up in the slack channel/Tell the Team Leader
8. Sudo code Everything ,comments comments comments comments
9. Leader has to set up a google form once a week to vote for a new leader (if more then half of active users agrees they revote) ??<< Fair ?
10. You will be Credited with the work you do (it will show on your git commits) but you can also add your name to the component you did at the bottom of this ReadMe
